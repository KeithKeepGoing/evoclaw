## [1.10.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Telegram Channel**: Fixed critical bug in `send_file()` where binary files (e.g., `.pptx`, `.pdf`, `.jpg`) would fail to send due to incorrect encoding handling (`cp950 codec can't decode` error).
  - Changed file reading to explicitly use binary mode (`rb`) and read entire content before sending.
  - Now uses `telegram.InputFile` to ensure binary data is properly transmitted.
  - Added MIME type detection with fallback to `application/octet-stream`.
  - Set `disable_content_type_detection=True` to prevent Telegram from re-encoding files.
  - Improved error logging for file sending failures.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Evolution Engine**: Full genome evolution with formality, technical_depth, and responsiveness genes.
- **Health Monitor**: Real-time system health tracking with automatic alerts.
- **DevEngine**: 7-stage automated development pipeline (Analyze → Design → Implement → Test → Review → Document → Deploy).
- **Web Dashboard**: 7-tab monitoring interface with Subagent hierarchy visualization.
- **Superpowers Integration**: 12 workflow skill packages from Superpowers methodology.

### Changed
- Replaced `threading.Lock` with `asyncio.Lock` for better async compatibility.
- GroupQueue now serializes container execution per group.
- WebPortal session timeout reduced to 1 hour.

### Fixed
- `_stop_container` now properly waits for `proc.wait()` to complete.
- `/api/env` now uses key whitelist for security.
- DevEngine JID fallback now provides clear error messages.
- macOS compatibility fixes for `.env` file handling.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
